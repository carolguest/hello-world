hello-world
===========

My first github repo

h2. Does and H2 heading work?

Here are some things I want to learn about github:
# Why do people like it so much?
# Do you write your code directly in here or offline then upload?
# How do you download and run an application out of github?
# What's with the cat logo thing?


_The End_
